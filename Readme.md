# Examples for StrataCode

This repository contains a bundle of layers to be used with StrataCode's scc or the IntelliJ plugin.

Put this bundle in the layer path and run examples - e.g.

    scc example.unitConverter.html.clientServer 

Some layers when run by themselves are incomplete, e.g. example.unitConverter.model - they typically will compile but won't do anything.

Go to the [complete list of runnable examples](http://www.stratacode.com/doc/exampleLayers.html)
